### Description of the Data
The raw data consisted variables derived using measurements taken from the embedded accelerometer and 
gyroscope of smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S II) carried by a group of 30 volunteers.  The experiment 
consisted of having each person perform six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and then capturing the accelerometer and gyroscope signals that were used 
to derive various variables.  For a more detailed description of the raw data and features, see the 
README file that accompanies the UCI HAR Data.  

The summarized data includes only the variables measuring the mean and standard deviation of each signal
averaged for each subject and each activity.  Each observation (each row) consists of a subject number,
an activity, and the averages of the mean and standard deviation of each signal taken for the subject 
during the activity.  

### Data Transformations  
1. The raw training and test sets were merged with their respective subject and activity vectors and appropriate variable names were assigned
2. The subsets of variables pertaining only to signal means and standard deviations were extracted from the raw training and test sets
3. The training and test subsets were merged with each other
4. The activity codes in the merged data were replaced with activity descriptions
5. The variable names were reconstructed in a more readable format
6. The merged data was grouped and averaged by subject and activity in order to produce the final summarized data
